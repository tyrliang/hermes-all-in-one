# Credential Lifecycle

v0.13.0 treats this doc as the operator loop behind the release story. The vault has to stay healthy on its own, explain drift clearly, and prove it can recover from a real backup, not just look freshly touched.

## 1. Discovery

- Hermes Vault scans approved Hermes-relevant paths
- Plaintext secrets, duplicates, and insecure permissions are identified

## 2. Import or Add

- Operator imports from `.env` or JSON, or manually adds a credential
- All additions flow through ``VaultMutations`` (centralized audit-backed mutation path)
- Operator path skips policy checks but produces audit entries
- Agent path requires ``add_credential`` capability and service action permission
- Raw secret is encrypted before being written to the vault
- Metadata records service, alias, type, provenance, timestamps, and crypto version
- Plaintext copies are allowed only during migration windows or explicit exemptions
- Long-lived plaintext under managed Hermes paths is a policy violation, not a normal state

## 3. Brokered Use

- Hermes or a sub-agent requests access through the broker
- Policy v2 determines whether access is allowed based on per-service action permissions
- Agent-level capabilities gate non-service-scoped actions (list, scan, export, import)
- Broker prefers ephemeral environment materialization for downstream task execution
- **v0.15.0: OAuth Freshness at Handoff** — Near-expiry OAuth tokens are automatically refreshed during `get_ephemeral_env` before the credential reaches the agent. The `rotate` permission is required for this live refresh; `get_env` alone does not authorize vault mutation. A 30-second per-credential cooldown prevents provider rate-limit abuse.
- All broker decisions are recorded in the audit log

## 4. Verification

- When a task fails or an operator requests verification, the verifier checks the credential against a provider endpoint
- Result is classified precisely
- Vault status and last verified timestamp are updated
- Non-auth failures such as network, scope, endpoint, and rate limit should remain distinct from invalid/expired credential results

## 5. Rotation

- Operator replaces the secret for an existing record
- Rotation flows through ``VaultMutations`` with policy check and audit
- Agent path requires ``rotate`` service action permission
- Old ciphertext is overwritten in the record
- Status returns to unknown until verification runs again

## 6. Deletion

- Operator explicitly confirms deletion
- Deletion flows through ``VaultMutations`` with policy check and audit
- Agent path requires ``delete`` service action permission
- Metadata and encrypted payload are removed from SQLite

## 7. Skill Contract

- Generated SKILL.md files tell agents to stop credential freelancing
- Verification-before-reauth is part of the required workflow
### Generated skills are review artifacts unless explicitly installed by the operator

## 8. Observability

v0.4.0 adds visibility into credential state and access history:

- hermes-vault audit queries the access log with filters by agent, service,
  action, decision, and time range
- hermes-vault status shows credential health: stale, invalid, or expiring
- hermes-vault set-expiry and clear-expiry record operator-defined expiry
  metadata on credentials
- hermes-vault verify --all --format table or --report provides structured
  verification output

These commands do not change credential security properties. No secrets are
ever exposed in audit, status, or verification output.

## 9. Recovery proof

- `hermes-vault backup-verify --input <backup-file>` proves a backup decrypts with the current vault key.
- `hermes-vault restore --dry-run --input <backup-file>` exercises restore semantics without mutating the live vault.
- Metadata-only backups are inspection artifacts, not recovery proofs.
- Backup age is a warning signal, not evidence that recovery will work.
