"""Regression tests for the audit-integrity TOCTOU race that lets
unprotected access_logs rows be written between the legacy snapshot
capture and the chain's first protected append.

The bug (pre-fix): `_legacy_snapshot()` ran BEFORE the BEGIN IMMEDIATE
in `ensure_initialized`, so any rows committed by other processes (or by
the same process reentering the append path during `initialize_schema`)
between snapshot capture and segment activation ended up outside the
prefix AND outside the protected chain. `verify()` then permanently
returned `missing_integrity_record`, and `AuditLogger.record()` raised
on every subsequent append — but `VaultMutations.add_credential` had
already committed the credential to `credentials`, leaving the vault
in a desynced state (credential exists, audit row missing).

The fix: capture the legacy snapshot INSIDE the same BEGIN IMMEDIATE
transaction as the segment insert, after `initialize_schema()` and
before the INSERTs. This makes snapshot capture and segment creation
atomic from the perspective of any concurrent writer.
