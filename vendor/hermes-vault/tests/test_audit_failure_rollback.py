"""Regression tests for #56 Slice A — preserve credentials on audit failure.

The pre-fix behavior in ``VaultMutations._record_mutation`` rolled back any
state-changing mutation whose protected audit append failed by deleting the
credential row. That is only correct for a brand-new add. Rotate, replace
(replace_existing), and delete destroyed the prior credential even though the
caller-visible message claimed the credential was preserved.

The fix adds ``Vault.restore_credential(record)`` (idempotent upsert by id)
and uses the captured before-image of the row to restore the original
ciphertext when the integrity chain refuses to seal the audit row. Delete is
kept only for genuine new-record adds.

Each test is red-capable: it fails on the pre-fix code (the credential row is
deleted or the audit error propagates) and passes once the before-image
restore path exists.
