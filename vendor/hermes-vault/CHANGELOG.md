# Changelog

## 0.26.0 -- Feature: Trustworthy Under Failure (2026-09-11)

Recovery that cannot brick the vault, authorization that is actually enforced, and existing surfaces (CLI, health, MCP) that stop lying — depth, not new surfaces. Nine packs: safe recovery (P1), authorization enforcement (P2), CLI truth (P3), MCP correctness (P4), crypto v2 default (P5), release & CI integrity (P6), `doctor` (P7), `run` (P8), and the Bitwarden interop on-ramp (P9). No vault storage-schema or backup-format changes; existing v1 credential rows stay readable.

### Fixed

- **Lease ownership enforced on list/show/renew/revoke (F-01)**: non-operator callers may now only access leases issued to themselves — `list_leases` applies the `agent_id` filter in the DB query itself (never post-fetch), and `show_lease`/`renew_lease`/`revoke_lease` require `lease.agent_id == caller` before the service-policy check and before any write. Previously an agent allowed on a service could inspect or alter any other agent's lease on that service. Operators/auditors holding the explicit new `manage_leases` capability keep cross-agent administration; it is never implicitly granted to legacy agents (empty capabilities list) — ownership is the security default. Negative cross-agent tests in `tests/test_authorization_enforcement.py`.
- **Expired credentials denied at final env materialization (F-03) — behavior change**: `get_ephemeral_env()` re-checks `record.expiry <= now` at the point of final materialization — after any OAuth refresh and re-resolution — and denies. Expiry is no longer advisory for ordinary credentials: a stale API key with an expiry timestamp can no longer be handed to an agent. A successful OAuth refresh (which moves expiry forward) still hands off; the only escape is the explicit `allow_expired_env` policy override (service entry overrides the agent-level default). `test_governance`'s expired-warning test deliberately changed pin: it pinned the old advisory behavior (expired api_key served with a warning) and now pins the deny with `expired_at` metadata and empty env.
- **`recover` no longer rebuilds on key mismatch (F-06) — BREAKING-fix**: `recover_checkpoint()`'s `active_key_mismatch` route to `_rebuild_integrity_for_key_mismatch()` is deleted — that path DROPped all integrity tables and rebuilt from current `access_logs`, erasing forensic evidence and covering up the exact state that means wrong key material. The mismatch now returns the failed verification with the salt-migration guidance.
- **Foreign-key restores fail closed — BREAKING-fix**: a backup whose payloads do not decrypt under the destination vault's key (previously imported cleanly, silently bricking the vault with "secret could not be decrypted") is blocked at two layers — the CLI preflight and the `import_backup` library guard — as `SaltMismatchError`/exit 1. Automation that relied on cross-key imports must share the salt file or re-export from a paired home.
- **"Days since last backup" was permanently "never"**: `backup` wrote the archive and returned without recording any audit row, while health and the broker backup reminder scanned for exactly such rows — every cron/scheduled CLI backup was invisible to health. `backup` now records an `export_backup` audit row (operator agent; path and `metadata_only` flag in metadata); audit failure degrades to a warning so the recovery tool is never blocked by an integrity wedge. The two duplicated scanners (`health.py`, `broker.py` inline) are deduplicated into `AuditLogger.last_backup_at()`, which also fixes a latent flaw both shared: it returns the genuinely most recent row across `export_backup`/`backup` actions instead of preferring `export_backup` regardless of timestamp.
- **PYTHONPATH leakage crashed the installed CLI**: the shipped console script died with `ModuleNotFoundError` in Hermes worker/cron shells whose global `PYTHONPATH` points into the agent venv (incompatible pydantic wheels shadow the tool's deps) — the #1 documented fleet friction, worked around everywhere with `env -u` prefixes. The v0.23.0 conftest pattern now runs at the installed entrypoint: `hermes_vault/_envguard.py` strips marker paths from `sys.path` and filters them from `PYTHONPATH` for child processes; dev/editable installs whose checkout path merely contains the marker are preserved (entry-file ancestor check). Verified against the real fleet path.
- **`verify` exit codes lied and its JSON was double-encoded**: `verify <unknown-service>` printed `allowed: false "credential not found in vault"` and exited 0 — pipelines branching on the exit code read real failures as success. `verify` now exits 1 when any target failed (not-found/denied, or `success=False`: invalid, network, rate-limit); mixed batches fail if any target failed. One exemption: a missing provider-specific verifier (`UNSUPPORTED_VERIFIER_REASON`) is a configured no-op, not a failed check — hoisted to a shared constant reused by the broker so the exit-code logic and the verifier cannot drift apart. `verify --format json` previously printed a JSON string containing JSON (rich `print_json` re-encodes str data); the object is now passed once. `broker get` and `broker list` had the same double-encoding defect on both allow and deny paths — fixed the same way (`broker env` was already correct).
- **Bare `--agent` failures gave no path forward**: `--agent <undefined>` printed only the bare denial JSON with no way to discover valid ids. A stderr hint (stdout JSON stays parseable) now lists the agents defined in the active policy, names the policy file, and surfaces the default-binding mechanism (`?agent_id=` / `HERMES_VAULT_MCP_DEFAULT_AGENT`); wired into `broker get/env/list`, the lease verbs, and `request access`. `broker list --agent <undefined>` stays exit 0 (an empty list is truthful) but explains why on stderr.
- **Advertised `vault://` resources were unreadable in unbound mode — intended behavior change**: generic MCP hosts do `resources/list` then `resources/read` on the advertised URI verbatim, and every one of the 10 advertised URIs returned `Missing required parameter: agent_id`. Bare resource reads now resolve to `HERMES_VAULT_MCP_DEFAULT_AGENT` unbound-mode fallback when set (normal policy-gated path, `binding_mode: "default_fallback"`), otherwise to the embedded operator default (`binding_mode: "operator_default"`) — the operator's metadata-only view, audit-logged, never secrets or encrypted payloads. Parameterized resources (`vault://policy-explain`, `vault://recovery`) keep their documented missing-parameter errors; tool calls remain agent-scoped in unbound mode. The test that pinned the old error envelope was deliberately rewritten — the old error WAS the bug.
- **MCP cold start died with a 53-line traceback on locked vaults**: tool calls and resource reads now return a typed `MISSING_PASSPHRASE` envelope (`locked: true`, mirroring the desktop bridge's 423 MISSING_PASSPHRASE) or `VAULT_NOT_READY` for missing/corrupt key material; the CLI entrypoint prints a one-line typed error on stderr if startup ever raises. The server also no longer builds the vault broker at startup — capabilities-only sessions (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `resources/list`, `resources/templates/list`) never require a decryptable vault; the broker is built on the first vault-touching request.
- **`oauth normalize` alias rename bricked v2 rows**: the legacy refresh-alias rename was a raw SQL `alias` UPDATE; on AAD-bound v2 rows (the alias is part of the canonical AAD) that left the row undecryptable. v2 rows are now decrypted with their pre-rename metadata and re-encrypted with the new alias bound in one atomic UPDATE; v1 rows keep the plain metadata rename. Exposed by the v2-default flip; regression tests cover both paths.
- **Windows-reader attribution corrected in the 0.25.1 notes (F-1)**: verified against git history — the Windows-safe reader mechanism (timeout-bounded `communicate()` runner, `ComSpec`/`USERPROFILE` safe-env entries, CRLF-tolerant framing) shipped with v0.25.0 (4d95bf3); #77's delta is `HOMEDRIVE`/`HOMEPATH` in the child-env allowlist plus the four regression tests.

### Changed

- **New writes produce AAD-bound `aesgcm-v2` envelopes by default**: `WRITE_CRYPTO_VERSION` flipped from `aesgcm-v1` (issue #60 write-side cutover). Existing v1 rows stay readable — decryption dispatches per-row on the stored `crypto_version`. Set `HERMES_VAULT_CRYPTO_VERSION=aesgcm-v1` to downgrade new writes (e.g. a fleet interoperating with an older consumer).
- **`import` is now a Typer group**: the legacy `--from-env`/`--from-file`/`--from-csv` flat flags work unchanged; `bitwarden` is the first interop subcommand.

### Added

- **Mandatory restore preflight + recovery receipts (P1)**: every `restore --yes` proves — before any mutation — that every credential payload in the backup decrypts under the live master key (`prove_backup_decryptable`), computes salt/key identity fingerprints, and writes a `restore-receipt-v1` JSON artifact under `$VAULT_HOME/recovery/` (atomic write, 0600, fail-closed: an unwritable recovery directory blocks the restore). `restore --dry-run` writes the same receipt with `mode: dry-run`. There is no `--skip-preflight`; the receipt records `proceed`/`blocked` + reason (`salt_mismatch`, `partial_decrypt_failure`, `integrity_evidence_invalid`), counts, fingerprints, and the two-phase outcome. Every real restore writes a protected `restore_preflight` audit event (allow/deny with counts, fingerprints, receipt path).
- **`audit-checkpoint repair` — non-destructive audit recovery (P1)**: read-only self-check by default (verify + store-decryptability proof + repair verdict, byte-identical db); `--yes --reason` executes the quarantine repair — the 6 audit tables (`access_logs`, `access_requests`, `audit_integrity_records`, `audit_integrity_segments`, `audit_integrity_state`, `audit_verification_runs`) are copied to `quarantine_<table>_<ts>` with an `audit_quarantine_manifest` row per table and a `vault.db.pre-repair-<ts>` safety copy, all inside one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction (no `DROP`, no `VACUUM`), then re-anchored via `ensure_initialized` + `establish_checkpoint`; a protected `audit_repair` event lands on the new chain with quarantine metadata plus any deferred recovery events recorded while the old chain was broken. Tamper-evidence reasons (`entry_digest_mismatch`, `sequence_gap`, …) and the salt-migration signature (`active_key_mismatch`) are refused with guidance — repair never destroys evidence or covers up a key-material brick. `--no-safety-copy` opts out of the file copy; the manifest records the choice.
- **Typed `SaltMismatchError` salt-migration guard (P1)**: a single canonical, actionable error block — why the mismatch happened, that hermes-vault never rotates `master_key_salt.bin` automatically, and the two recovery options (restore the paired salt or re-export from a paired home; never delete `vault.db`/salt). `load_or_create_master_key` refuses salt creation when a `vault.db` exists next to the missing default salt file.
- **`hermes-vault doctor` (P7)**: one read-only command for install and recovery health — binary integrity (version, import, PYTHONPATH-poisoning signal), launcher/home layout (db/salt pairing, salt shape, key-material file permissions, passphrase source), store integrity (keyless `PRAGMA quick_integrity_check`), salt/key pairing, audit-chain state (verify + repair verdict with the named command), optional `--backup` pairing, and MCP wiring (config entry shape incl. the documented `args:`-string trap, resolvable command, JSON-RPC `initialize` smoke). Human-readable findings plus `--json` (`doctor-v1`) for agents; exit 0 healthy / 1 degraded / 2 broken. Wraps P1's primitives as-is and owns no recovery logic: never mutates the store, never writes audit rows (a wedged chain cannot crash it), never prompts, never creates a vault. The two documented ops bricking traps surface as named failures: audit wedge → `repairable` + the exact `audit-checkpoint repair` command; rotated salt → `KEY-MATERIAL MISMATCH`, never a cover-up repair. New `docs/doctor.md`.
- **`hermes-vault run` (P8)**: `run [--agent ID] [--service S ...] [--alias A] [--ttl N] -- <cmd>` injects vault-backed env variables ONLY into the child process environment for its lifetime — the exact contract CrewAI/LangChain/MCP `env:` blocks speak. Resolution calls `Broker.get_ephemeral_env` verbatim (the `broker env` path), so policy deny-by-default, TTL clamping, lease ownership + expiry enforcement, OAuth freshness, and expiry-at-handoff all apply unchanged; operator authority bypass is a non-goal. All-or-nothing across multiple `--service` flags: the first denial aborts before the child spawns, and a target-variable collision fails closed. With no `--service`, injects every policy-`get_env`-allowed service with a stored credential. `--agent` falls back to `HERMES_VAULT_MCP_DEFAULT_AGENT`; undefined agents get the actionable stderr hint. Secrets never appear in argv, logs, or the audit record — a `run_env_inject` audit row carries service and variable NAMES plus the command name and TTL — and passphrase env vars (`HERMES_VAULT_PASSPHRASE`/`HERMES_VAULT_PASSPHRASE_<PROFILE>`) are always stripped from the child. Shell exit conventions preserved (child's code propagates, 128+N signals, 127/126 not-found/not-executable, 1 denials, 2 usage). New `docs/run.md`.
- **`import bitwarden` + interop docs (P9, answers #84/#85)**: import bridge for unencrypted `bw export --format json` files — logins → credentials (username→alias with intra-import dedup, password→secret, TOTP seed preserved as a `totp:` line inside the secret, custom fields → encrypted secret metadata, item notes → plaintext notes, folders → service-name prefixes); secure notes → note credentials; card/identity/no-password items counted and skipped with explicit reasons — nothing silently dropped. `--dry-run` previews the full plan without a passphrase or vault and never prints a secret; `--json` emits a clean machine payload (warnings on stderr); apply goes through the audited `VaultMutations.add_credential` path with `imported_from=bitwarden` provenance, `imported`/`bitwarden` tags, and a summary `import_bitwarden` audit event. Collision policy `--on-collision skip|rename|fail` resolves against the live vault before any write; encrypted exports are rejected with guidance; exit codes 2 (usage/parse) / 1 (collision-fail, cancel, denied) / 0. New `docs/multi-client.md` (single-host multi-client topology, per-agent policy identities, the five "what NOT to do" patterns, explicit non-goals) and `docs/bitwarden-comparison.md` (dated, source-cited comparison — every Bitwarden claim linked to their public help center, verified 2026-09-11).
- **`migrate-crypto` (P5, opt-in v1→v2 re-encryption)**: `Vault.migrate_crypto()` re-encrypts legacy `aesgcm-v1` rows as AAD-bound `aesgcm-v2` inside one `BEGIN EXCLUSIVE` transaction and verifies EVERY row decrypts under its post-migration version + authorization metadata before committing — any failure rolls back completely; partial migrations are never committed and the vault stays fully readable in its pre-migration state. Undecryptable rows and unknown `crypto_version` labels are refused up front with actionable errors. The CLI is explicit and opt-in (`--dry-run` reports eligibility, `--yes` skips the prompt); success, refusal, and dry-run outcomes are audited; refusal exits non-zero.
- **Policy controls for authorization enforcement (P2 groundwork)**: `manage_leases` agent capability (explicit-only escape hatch for cross-agent lease administration/audit) and the `allow_expired_env` override (service entry overrides agent-level default, default false), both surfaced in `docs/operator-guide.md`.
- **`--version` flag**: eager root option prints `hermes-vault <version>` and exits 0 before any dispatch (the app() console-script proxy short-circuits root-only `--version` argv so the splash banner never mixes in); a single parseable line for scripts. Live probe at v0.25.1 died with click exit 2.
- **Release & CI integrity (P6)**: `publish-to-pypi.yml` now runs the full test matrix (ubuntu/windows × py3.11/3.12, core + both plugin suites) and gates `pypi-publish` on it — tags previously published with zero test execution. New CI jobs: lock-freshness (`uv lock --check` — the #81 stale-lock class, killed permanently) and locked-set dependency advisory (pip-audit `--require-hashes` over `uv export --locked` output — audits the exact hash-pinned set a lock-based install gets). `tests/test_ci_contract.py` pins the workflow invariants structurally so a future edit cannot silently drop a guard. The v0.23.1 release strays are committed for archive parity; `.worktrees/` ignored.
- **Docs**: `docs/safe-recovery.md` — operator guide for the restore preflight, receipt schema, blocked-restore recovery options, and repair semantics; operator-guide sections for recovery, doctor, run, crypto versions, and Bitwarden import; README common-commands and quickstart updates.

### Tests

- Suite: **1190 → 1506 passed** (exit 0). New test files (192 tests): `test_p1_safe_recovery.py` (16 — both documented bricking traps as end-to-end regressions, transactionality, refusal classes, receipt lifecycle), `test_authorization_enforcement.py` (21 — negative cross-agent lease access + expiry-at-handoff), `test_p7_doctor.py` (31 — every check path, exit-code contract, read-only guarantees), `test_p8_run.py` (31 — broker-path composition, deny-by-default, env+audit hygiene, exit codes), `test_bitwarden_import.py` (36), `test_crypto_migration.py` (12), `test_envguard.py` (7), `test_version_flag.py` (5), `test_verify_exit_codes.py` (9), `test_agent_id_errors.py` (7), `test_backup_audit_row.py` (9), `test_ci_contract.py` (8).
- Deliberately rewritten pins (the old behavior WAS the bug): `test_mcp_server` unbound-resource error pin; `test_governance` expired-credential warning pin; `test_cli` double-encoded verify JSON + failed-verify exit-0 pins; `test_recover_checkpoint_handles_active_key_mismatch` → `test_recover_checkpoint_refuses_key_mismatch_without_rebuild`.

### Upgrade notes

- Users on 0.25.x should reinstall as 0.26.0 (`uv tool install --force git+https://github.com/asimons81/hermes-vault.git@v0.26.0` or the pipx equivalent). No vault storage-schema or backup-format changes; `hvbackup-v2` backups are unchanged.
- **Crypto**: new writes are `aesgcm-v2` (AAD-bound) as of this release; existing v1 rows stay readable, and `migrate-crypto` is strictly opt-in — nothing re-encrypts automatically. Pre-v0.24.0 hermes-vault releases cannot read v2 rows: a fleet interoperating with older consumers can set `HERMES_VAULT_CRYPTO_VERSION=aesgcm-v1` to keep new writes on v1 (unknown values are rejected). This is the only new environment variable.
- **Behavior changes to review before upgrading**: expired credentials are now denied at env handoff (set `allow_expired_env` in policy to keep serving them deliberately); cross-agent lease administration now requires the `manage_leases` capability; restores of backups encrypted under a different key are blocked (share the salt file or re-export from a paired home); `recover` refuses to rebuild on key mismatch; `verify` exits 1 on failed checks (fix any script that branched on the old exit-0); bare MCP resource reads now succeed in unbound mode; the MCP server returns typed lock envelopes instead of dying on locked vaults.
- The `env -u PYTHONPATH` prefix workaround for Hermes worker/cron shells is no longer needed — the installed CLI scrubs the leakage itself.

## 0.25.1 -- Patch: Desktop plugin fixes + mcp 2.x support (2026-09-10)

### Fixed

- **False ✗ Integrity stat (Desktop plugin)**: the plugin header derived its Integrity stat from `overview.health.integrity_status`, which the bridge never emits — v0.25.0 rendered a false red ✗ Check on healthy vaults. The header now derives it from the `/integrity` endpoint, with fixtures mirroring the real bridge payload and an explicit regression assertion. Found during post-approval live verification; content landed on master via #80 (squash of the fix-branch work) with the UTF-8 node-harness decode for Windows.
- **Windows plugin adapter crashes (#77, fixes #76)**: the Windows-safe reader mechanism — routing children to the timeout-bounded `communicate()` fallback instead of the POSIX-only `os.set_blocking`/`selectors.select()` path (`os.set_blocking` is absent on Windows and `selectors.select()` rejects anonymous pipe fds, WinError 10093), the `ComSpec`/`USERPROFILE` safe-env entries, and CRLF normalization before the strict single-line framing check — shipped with v0.25.0 (4d95bf3). #77's delta completes it: `_SAFE_ENV_KEYS` adds `HOMEDRIVE`/`HOMEPATH` so `.cmd` canonical launchers can expand user-profile paths, and regression tests cover all four Windows crashes (launcher keys, CRLF acceptance, embedded-newline/bare-CR rejection, no POSIX-only pipe primitives in the bridge path).

### Changed

- **MCP SDK floor raised to 2.x (#81 follow-up)**: `mcp>=2.0.0,<3.0.0` in runtime + dev deps (0.25.0 shipped `>=1.0.0,<2.0.0`; #81 had widened the range to admit 1.x, which never worked). `mcp_server.py` registers handlers explicitly via the mcp 2.x low-level API (`server.add_request_handler("tools/list", ...)`) — mcp 2.0.0 removed the decorator API and renamed wire kwargs to snake_case — so the package requires mcp 2.x (the lock pins 2.2.0); the floor now excludes mcp 1.x, which lacks `add_request_handler` entirely and would crash at import. Master's `uv.lock` was also left stale by #81 (still resolving mcp 1.27.0 against server code that requires the 2.x API, breaking lock-based installs of master tip); this release regenerates the lock with mcp 2.2.0.
- **README hero (#86)**: architecture diagram (`assets/hermes-vault-architecture.webp`) replaces the promo image.
- **Site branding + hero asset**: black/white/red Studio color scheme with modern Studio header and AIowa LLC footer (from the deployed site's branding pass); the hero `site/assets/hermes-vault-architecture.webp` referenced by the deployed `site/index.html` (hero `<img>` + `og:image`) is now tracked in git — deploys from a fresh clone no longer serve a broken hero.
- **Site deploy script**: `scripts/deploy-hermesvault-site.sh` now calls the local `vercel` CLI directly (`vercel link` / `vercel deploy --prod` / `vercel alias set`) instead of shelling through `npx --yes vercel` — part of the site branding pass.

### Tests

- **Concurrent OAuth refresh hardening (#82)**: the concurrent-refresh test no longer trips barrier timeouts (flaky on loaded CI runners).
- **Audit-integrity TOCTOU hardening (#83)**: the concurrent-writer test no longer races Windows file locks.

### Upgrade notes

- No upgrade or migration steps required. No vault schema or backup-format changes. Users on 0.25.0 should reinstall as 0.25.1 (`uv tool install --force git+https://github.com/asimons81/hermes-vault.git@v0.25.1` or the pipx equivalent). Windows Desktop plugin users get the adapter fix on next plugin adapter restart.
## 0.25.0 -- Feature: Desktop Mutation Surface (2026-08-10)

### Added

- **Bridge mutation methods** (`src/hermes_vault/desktop_bridge.py`): `add`, `rotate`, and `delete` NDJSON methods behind an explicit `--allow-mutations` flag (default off). Each method rejects renderer-supplied `agent_id`, validates `request_id`, routes through `Broker` → `VaultMutations` (the single audited write path), traps `AuditIntegrityError`, and returns metadata-only responses. Delete enforces a typed confirmation token (credential id or `service:alias`) before any write.
- **Adapter mutation routes** (`plugins/hermes-vault-desktop/dashboard/plugin_api.py`): `POST /mutations/{add,rotate,delete}` gated behind `HERMES_VAULT_DESKTOP_MUTATIONS=1` (404 when unset). Bearer-only auth (no `?token=` fallback), pre-spawn body validation with an allowlist, `--allow-mutations` passed to the bridge child only on mutation routes, and R1 Host-header hardening on the adapter router.
- **Desktop mutation UI** (`plugins/hermes-vault-desktop/desktop/plugin.js`): add / rotate / delete dialogs with masked secret fields, type-to-confirm delete, single-flight buttons, error-state taxonomy, and audit result display. Version-gated by the `/hello` `mutations` capability — read-only mode is preserved when the flag is off.
- **Docs**: `docs/mutation-surface-rollback.md` — per-surface rollback procedures, recovery drill, lease impact, and known limits (risks R1–R9).
- **Tests**: `tests/test_desktop_bridge_mutations.py` (13), `plugins/hermes-vault-desktop/tests/test_plugin_api_mutations.py` (39), plus same-mount React #310 phase-flip regression tests for `VaultPage` and `DeleteCredentialDialog`.

### Security

- Mutations are deny-by-default: operator agent only via the bridge, policy-gated for non-operator agents, every write audited through the protected audit chain.
- `AuditIntegrityError` rolls back credential writes on add/rotate and returns HTTP 409 at the adapter; delete is destructive and documented as irreversible (backup reminder in the delete dialog).
- Raw secrets are never serialized in any bridge/adapter response; renderer memory zeroization limitation (R6) is documented and accepted.

### Fixed

- React #310 on the real Hermes Desktop: `VaultPage` and `DeleteCredentialDialog` hook declarations hoisted above conditional early returns (same-mount loading→success phase-flip regression tests fail pre-fix with the exact #310).
- Integration-caught drift: mutation calls no longer append query params (I6), delete confirmation token derives `service:alias` or full id (I2), hello/health restored to release bounded-query behavior.

### Upgrade notes

- The mutation surface is **opt-in**. Existing read-only desktop installs are unaffected until `HERMES_VAULT_DESKTOP_MUTATIONS=1` is set on the adapter environment AND the bridge is run with `--allow-mutations`. Rollback at any time by unsetting the flag (routes return 404) or restoring v0.24.0 files (`docs/mutation-surface-rollback.md`).
- The desktop plugin remains operator-only for mutations; agent-scoped mutations are out of scope (R7).

## 0.24.0 -- Feature: Hermes Desktop Integration (2026-08-06)

### Added

- **Desktop bridge (`desktop-bridge`)**: Vault-owned versioned NDJSON bridge with a `--no-banner desktop-bridge` CLI entry point. Strict protocol/request validation, UTF-8 byte-based request limits, recursion-safe JSON parsing, rejection of `NaN`/`Infinity`, bounded output with attacker-controlled IDs nulled on overflow, error redaction for paths/JWTs/bearer/hex tokens, read-only SQLite access, and no Hermes Agent imports or shell execution.
- **Backend adapter (`plugins/hermes-vault-desktop/dashboard`)**: thin FastAPI plugin exposing only fixed GET routes (`hello`, `health`, `overview`, `credentials`, `leases`, `policy`, `requests`, `audit`, `integrity`). One short-lived bridge child per request, allowlisted child environment (`PYTHONPATH` and provider keys excluded), bounded request/response framing, timeouts, and sanitized error envelopes. Fails closed on timeout, EOF, malformed JSON, protocol mismatch, and output overflow.
- **Desktop runtime (`plugins/hermes-vault-desktop/desktop/plugin.js`)**: native Hermes Desktop plugin page — vault overview cards, credential/lease/request metadata, audit trail, integrity verification, and 30s auto-refresh. Read-only by construction; no Vault mutation surface.
- **Plugin tests**: `test_plugin_api.py` (route surface, query bounds, env allowlist, bridge error mapping) and `test_runtime_plugin.py` (structure, route registration, id consistency) run without a live Vault or Hermes process.

### Changed

- **Canonical-launcher requirement**: the adapter spawns `hermes-vault-canonical` (resolved from PATH) so the bridge unlocks from the 0600 passphrase file and runs with a cleared `PYTHONPATH`. The raw `hermes-vault` binary returns HTTP 423 `MISSING_PASSPHRASE` in the scrubbed child environment (the child env deliberately contains no passphrase).

### Upgrade notes

- No upgrade or migration steps required. The desktop integration is additive. Operators enabling the desktop plugin must have the canonical launcher (`hermes-vault-canonical`) on the Hermes service PATH.

## 0.23.2 -- Patch: audit chain wedge + export fail-closed (2026-08-01)

### Fixed

- **Audit chain wedge (HIGH)**: six CLI write paths (`set-expiry`, `clear-expiry`, `backup-verify`, `restore --dry-run`, `rotate-master-key` pre-rotation logger, and `recovery drill`) constructed `AuditLogger` without a master key, so their audit rows were written through the legacy unprotected INSERT branch. The next integrity-protected append then failed with `AuditIntegrityError: An audit row is not protected by an integrity record`, wedging the entire chain so `delete`, `add`, lease issuance, and access requests crashed. All six sites now pass `master_key=vault.key` (matching `build_services`), keeping the chain protected after every operator action.
- **Export fail-closed (MEDIUM)**: `export --with-secrets` with a wrong passphrase used to exit 0 and write `"secret": null` for every credential because decrypt exceptions were swallowed. It now fails with a clear error and non-zero exit instead of emitting null secrets.

### Added

- Regression tests (`tests/test_audit_chain_regression.py`) that reproduce the smoke-test sequence for each of the six commands — seed the chain with a protected `add`, run the command, then assert `audit-verify` stays healthy and a subsequent mutation still succeeds — plus fail-closed export coverage.

### Upgrade notes

- No upgrade or migration steps required. Users on 0.23.0/0.23.1 should reinstall as 0.23.2 (`uv tool install hermes-vault==0.23.2` or reinstall the git URL).

## 0.23.1 -- Patch: mcp SDK cap (2026-08-01)

### Fixed

- **Cap mcp SDK below 2.0**: pin `mcp>=1.0.0,<2.0.0` in runtime and dev dependencies. mcp 2.0.0 removed `Server.list_tools`, which broke `import hermes_vault.mcp_server` (line 853, `@server.list_tools()`) on fresh pip installs of 0.23.0.

### Upgrade notes

- No upgrade or migration steps required. Users on 0.23.0 should reinstall as 0.23.1 (`uv tool install hermes-vault==0.23.1` or reinstall the git URL) so pip resolves mcp < 2.0.0.

## 0.23.0 -- Maintenance & Docs (2026-08-01)

### Fixed

- **PYTHONPATH pollution guard**: `tests/conftest.py` now strips `sys.path` entries containing `hermes-agent` before test collection, so the Hermes agent venv's Python 3.11 pydantic can no longer leak into uv's Python 3.12 process and break collection with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic_core._pydantic_core'`. Cherry-picked from `release/v0.22.0` (`a9057bd`).

### Docs

- Add independent post-release sanity verification record for the v0.21.0 release to `release-readiness/v0.21.0/readiness-report.md` (`ecc9947`).

### Chore

- Bump all version surfaces to 0.23.0 (package metadata, README, site, tests).

### Upgrade notes

- No upgrade or migration steps required. 0.23.0 contains no storage schema, encryption, key-derivation, or policy changes since v0.22.0.

## 0.22.0 -- Vault Intelligence

### Added

- **Universal verification coverage**: 39 shipped YAML verifier configs for all 45 canonical service IDs, loaded from `src/hermes_vault/verifier_configs/`. Adding a new verifier now takes 4 lines of YAML.
- **`--unverified` and `--stale` filters** on `hermes-vault list` to find credentials needing attention.
- **`--service` and `--tag` filters** on `hermes-vault list` for targeted credential views.
- **Verification coverage %** in `hermes-vault health` alongside registered verifier count.
- **Health score (A-F)** in health reports and dashboard, based on coverage, staleness, and findings count.
- **CSV import** via `hermes-vault import --from-csv` with custom column mapping.
- **Filtered credential export**: `hermes-vault export --format json|csv|env` with `--service`, `--tag`, and `--unverified` filters.
- **Tag management CLI**: `hermes-vault tag <target> --add|--remove|--set`.
- **`hermes-vault catalog`**: lists all 45 canonical services with env vars, verifier status, and descriptions.
- **`hermes-vault schedule-verify`**: generates systemd timer or cron templates for automated credential verification.
- **`hermes-vault setup`**: interactive first-time vault setup wizard.
- **Verifier.count_registered_services()** for programmatic coverage queries.
- Shipped verifier configs are loaded before user overrides — operator YAML files in `$HERMES_VAULT_HOME/verifiers/` take precedence.

### Fixed

- **PR #45 merged**: TOCTOU race in `ensure_initialized` that left audit rows outside the integrity chain, plus non-atomic credential+audit writes that now roll back credentials on chain failure. (Thanks @doronkatz)

### Changed

- Health report now includes `verification_coverage`, `registered_verifiers`, and `health_score` fields.
- `hermes-vault verify --all` now has 45 registered verifiers (up from 6).

### Security

- No changes to encryption, key derivation, or vault storage schema.
- Verifier configs ship with well-known public API endpoints only — no secrets embedded.
- Stub configs for undocumented services use httpbin.org as placeholder.

## 0.21.0 -- Audit Assurance

### Added

- Signed audit-integrity chains with deterministic canonical serialization, HKDF-derived Ed25519 evidence signatures, and versioned integrity records.
- Durable authenticated checkpoints with signature verification, write-lock coordination, and explicit operator-only lifecycle (establish, advance, recover).
- Legacy migration anchoring with non-destructive, idempotent v0.20→v0.21 transition.
- Read-only verification result model with explicit healthy, legacy, incomplete, and failed states.
- **`hvbackup-v2`** backup format including audit integrity evidence, segments, checkpoint, and verification summary.
- v2 backup verification with structural consistency checks and key compatibility validation.
- Transactional restore with staged database and checkpoint replacement, rollback evidence, and audited operator restore event.
- **CLI commands**: `audit-verify`, `audit-checkpoint` (show/establish/advance/recover), `audit-export --with-integrity`.
- **Dashboard endpoints**: `GET /api/audit-integrity`, `POST /api/audit-integrity/verify`.
- **MCP resources**: `vault://audit-integrity` metadata-only resource, integrity summary in `vault://status`.
- Sanitized integrity summaries in incident bundles and recovery reports.
- Master-key rotation segments with predecessor chain continuity.
- Full Linux and Windows test matrix with 800+ passing tests.

### Security boundaries

- Private signing material is derived only in memory and is neither stored nor exported.
- Integrity-key material is never logged, serialized, or environment-placed.
- Checkpoint reset, advancement, and recovery remain explicit and operator-only (require `--yes`).
- Verification is read-only across CLI, dashboard, and MCP surfaces.
- Secret Source and MCP credential authority are unchanged.
- Pre-v0.21 audit history is preserved and readable but was not retrospectively protected.
- Local integrity verification is not third-party attestation.

### Compatibility

- v0.20 vaults open without destructive migration; legacy audit rows become anchored.
- Interrupted migration is safe to retry.
- `hvbackup-v1` backups remain fully restorable (classified as legacy).
- Metadata-only backups are non-restorable.
- Windows and POSIX behavior uses the existing platform abstraction.
- DPAPI-backed and passphrase-backed vaults provide the same audit-integrity behavior.
- No automatic downgrade is guaranteed after protected audit entries are written.

### Added

- Standalone Hermes Secret Source plugin under `plugins/hermes-vault-secret-source/`.
- Non-interactive `hermes-vault secret-source fetch` endpoint for mapped, read-only startup env materialization.
- Secret Source CLI, plugin, conformance, and fake-CLI contract tests.
- Explicit startup mapping support for `ENV_VAR=hv://service` and `ENV_VAR=hv://service?alias=name` refs.

### Changed

- Version surfaces now report `0.20.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, and site release copy.
- README, operator docs, threat model, plugin docs, and site copy now present Secret Source as startup-only while MCP remains the in-loop agent control plane.
- The plugin keeps `HERMES_VAULT_PASSPHRASE` protected, omits empty values, and keeps partial success as warnings instead of hard failures.

### Verification

- Focused suites: `python -m pytest tests/test_secret_source_cli.py plugins/hermes-vault-secret-source/tests tests/test_cli.py tests/test_broker.py tests/test_config.py tests/test_redaction.py -q --tb=short`
- Full release validation: `python -m pytest -q --tb=short`
- Upstream Hermes conformance: `tests.secret_sources.conformance.SecretSourceConformance` against the installed Hermes Agent package
- Manual smoke: isolated vault startup fetches for missing passphrase, valid mapped secret, alias ref, empty secret, denied policy, malformed ref, and closed-stdin no-prompt behavior

### Added

- Explainable policy decisions through `hermes-vault policy explain`, `policy simulate`, dashboard policy explain, MCP `policy_explain`, and `vault://policy-explain`.
- Lease-enforced env handoffs with opt-in `require_lease_for_env` and `require_lease_purpose` policy fields, broker-side lease reuse, `lease checkout`, MCP `lease_checkout`, and metadata showing the lease boundary.
- Operator access-request workflow across vault persistence, broker audit, CLI `request access/list/show/approve/deny`, dashboard Approval Inbox, MCP `request_access`, and `vault://requests`.
- Agent context manifests through `hermes-vault agent context`, dashboard Agent Context, and MCP `vault://agent-context`; responses are metadata-only and include redaction boundaries.
- Recovery and incident evidence upgrades with `recovery drill`, dashboard Recovery Drill, MCP `vault://recovery`, and redacted `incident bundle` archives.
- Dashboard Command Center for agent context, policy explain, access requests, approval decisions, and recovery drills.

### Fixed

- `maintain` now accepts the clearer `--print-schedule` alias while preserving `--print-systemd` compatibility.
- Windows CLI help no longer crashes when Rich renders service-normalization help in legacy code pages.
- MCP asyncio tests use `asyncio.run`, removing the release-regression deprecation warning.
- The example policy file is plain ASCII again and documents v0.19 lease enforcement fields.
- Incident bundle live generation now calls health with the supported argument set.

### Changed

- Version surfaces now report `0.19.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, and MCP server metadata.
- README, operator docs, MCP docs, and site copy now present Agent Control Plane as the current release.

### Verification

- Focused suites: `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_policy.py tests/test_broker.py tests/test_cli.py tests/test_mcp_server.py tests/test_dashboard.py -q --tb=short`
- Full release validation: `uv run python -m pytest tests/ -q --tb=short`
- Build validation: `uv run --with build python -m build`

## 0.18.0 -- Operator Workflow Convergence

### Added

- Dashboard Onboarding Preview action for dry-run bootstrap/import summaries, including redacted import counts, skipped entries, policy doctor summary, skill next step, and MCP config snippet.
- Dashboard Recovery Hub diff support, pairing metadata-only backup drift with backup verification and restore dry-run.
- Client-side dashboard search, status filters, and sorting for credential, lease, and audit tables.
- MCP `vault://status` resource for policy-scoped health, lease, backup, policy, profile, and safe next-step metadata.
- Release readiness and roadmap artifacts for the v0.18.0 release train.

### Fixed

- Dashboard overview now renders the lease metric returned by the backend.
- Dashboard vault-key validation now checks all credential records instead of only the first sample.
- MCP browser OAuth logins now include unique `login_id` values so concurrent same-provider/same-alias attempts do not collide.
- Current dashboard UI and host-binding errors no longer refer to stale v0.8 operational copy.

### Changed

- Version surfaces now report `0.18.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, and `uv.lock`.
- The public site and README now present Operator Workflow Convergence as the current release.

### Verification

- Focused dashboard/MCP regression suite: `uv run pytest tests/test_dashboard.py tests/test_mcp_server.py -q --tb=short`

## 0.17.0 -- Lease Assurance

### Added

- Full lease lifecycle backfill across vault, broker, MCP, CLI, backup/recovery, release regression, health, maintenance, policy doctor, and diff coverage.
- Lease-aware health reporting with active, expired, revoked, and total lease counts in CLI, JSON, and MCP health surfaces.
- Lease-aware maintenance with `--cleanup-leases` for idempotent expired-lease revocation during scheduled runs.
- Lease-focused policy doctor warnings for agents that can issue leases without access materialization rights or revoke leases without issue authority.
- Lease drift reporting in backup diff output, including added, removed, and changed lease state.

### Changed

- Broker and CLI lease flows now use the real method contracts end-to-end, including correct broker argument wiring and metadata-safe deny responses for MCP lease tools.
- Vault lease renewal now allows expired leases to be renewed from the current time, and double-revocation now fails closed with a clear error.
- Version surfaces now report `0.17.0` in `pyproject.toml` and `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`.

### Verification

- Full test suite: `uv run pytest tests/ -q`
- Import check: `uv run python -c "import hermes_vault; print(hermes_vault.__version__)"`

## 0.16.0 -- Agent Access Lifecycle

### Added

- Lease lifecycle support: agents and operators can issue, list, inspect, renew, and revoke time-bound leases over credential access.
- Policy pack templates: reusable starter packs now provide a coherent policy baseline for operator and agent workflows.
- Dashboard and MCP surfacing: lease metadata is visible through the local dashboard and MCP server without exposing raw secrets.

### Changed

- Release closeout: version surfaces now report `0.16.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, `src/hermes_vault/mcp_server.py`, and `uv.lock`.
- README release notes now describe the Agent Access Lifecycle release at the top of the document.

### Verification

- Full `uv run pytest` passed after the lease, policy-pack, and release-surface updates.

## 0.15.1 -- EvoLink Provider Support

### Added

- EvoLink provider support: `evolink` is now a canonical service ID, env-name hints recognize `EVOLINK_API_KEY`, and provider verification has a direct EvoLink models check.
- Release closeout: version surfaces now report `0.15.1` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, and `src/hermes_vault/mcp_server.py`.

### Changed

- README release notes now describe the EvoLink patch release instead of repeating the prior OAuth freshness story as the latest release.

### Verification

- Targeted release regression tests passed for the EvoLink-related surfaces and release version assertions.

## 0.15.0 -- Agent OAuth Freshness

### Added

- Agent OAuth Freshness: broker/MCP env handoff auto-refreshes near-expiry OAuth tokens before the credential reaches the agent, reducing stale-token failures.
- New `oauth_refresh` metadata field in `BrokerDecision` surfaced through CLI and MCP responses, enabling agent-visible freshness status.
- Refresh cooldown of 30 seconds per credential prevents provider rate-limit abuse from repeated handoffs.
- Sanitized failure handling: expired + unrecoverable OAuth tokens are denied with a clean error — no raw token leakage.
- Policy gate: live refresh requires the existing `rotate` service action permission; `get_env` alone does not authorize vault mutation.
- CLI `broker env` JSON output now includes `oauth_refresh` metadata.
- MCP `get_ephemeral_env` response includes a `metadata` field with `oauth_refresh` status.

### Changed

- Dashboard live refresh remains dry-run-only; live token mutation is CLI-only.
- Version surfaces now report `0.15.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, and `src/hermes_vault/mcp_server.py`.

### Verification

- Full test suite: 687 passed, 1 skipped (includes 8 broker, 2 CLI, and 2 MCP OAuth freshness tests, plus policy and audit verification tests).

## 0.14.0 -- Native Windows + DPAPI Master-Key Protection

### Added

- DPAPI-based master-key wrapping on Windows, opt-in via `HERMES_VAULT_DPAPI=1` and the new `pywin32` extra. Backward compatible: existing vaults continue to use the legacy passphrase-only path with no migration.
- New `_platform.py` abstraction layer that centralizes every OS-dependent call site (default vault home, default scan roots, file permissions, durable writes, command formatting, browser opening, DPAPI availability) so Windows behavior is consistent and POSIX behavior is unchanged.
- New `docs/windows.md` install, path, CLI, OAuth, backup, scheduled-maintenance, security, and known-limitations guide for Windows users.
- New `tests/test_platform.py` covers Windows code paths via `monkeypatch` of `_is_windows` and `_platform.dpapi_available`, matching the existing test idiom.
- New `tests/test_dpapi.py` covers lazy import failure, DPAPI protect/unprotect roundtrip, Windows monkeypatch, non-Windows no-op, mixed passphrase + DPAPI, and the legacy-vault migration path (20 new test cases).
- Constructor opt-in via `HERMES_VAULT_DPAPI=1` with stderr warning and legacy fallback when DPAPI is unavailable.
- Rotation uses format-agnostic read plus a DPAPI-aware write path.
- Magic-header detection (`b"HVDP"`) so legacy 16-byte salt vaults continue to work without intervention.

### Changed

- `src/hermes_vault/crypto.py` gained the `load_or_create_master_key(salt_path, passphrase, *, enable_dpapi=True)` wrapper that auto-detects the on-disk format and raises a clear error when DPAPI is requested but unavailable.
- `src/hermes_vault/vault.py` constructor and `rotate-master-key` path now wrap the master key with DPAPI on Windows when enabled.
- `src/hermes_vault/_platform.py` is the single source of truth for platform behavior. `dpapi_available()` is the only public DPAPI helper.
- `pyproject.toml` adds a `[windows]` optional extra declaring `pywin32`.
- `docs/windows.md` "Known Limitations" table now lists DPAPI as supported when `pywin32` is installed, with the passphrase still required.
- Version surfaces now report `0.14.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, `src/hermes_vault/mcp_server.py`, and `uv.lock`.

### Verification

- Full test suite: 676 passed, 0 failed (656 baseline + 20 new DPAPI tests).
- All CLI commands cited in the new Windows docs were checked against `python -m hermes_vault.cli --help`.
- DPAPI is opt-in and the legacy passphrase path is exercised on every test run for backward-compat assurance.

## 0.13.0 -- Credential Lifecycle & Recovery

### Added

- A top-level 0.13.0 release framing in the README so the product story now opens with lifecycle and recovery instead of older auth-readiness language.
- A lifecycle and recovery runbook in the operator guide that separates freshness checks, live health verification, scheduled maintenance, policy drift review, and recovery proof.

### Changed

- `maintain` now says it only covers refresh + health and points operators to `policy doctor`, `backup-verify`, and `restore --dry-run` for the missing assurance.
- `maintain` is documented as lifecycle assurance, not as a substitute for backup verification or restore drills.
- Recovery guidance now treats `backup-verify` and `restore --dry-run` as the proof path, and backup age as a warning, not proof.
- README and operator guide now frame Hermes Vault v0.13.0 as the lifecycle and recovery release.
- Policy doctor wording keeps refresh permissions separate from rotation expectations instead of blurring them together.
- Architecture and credential-lifecycle notes now match the new release story.
- Version surfaces now report `0.13.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, `src/hermes_vault/mcp_server.py`, and `uv.lock`.

### Verification

- Full test suite passed with `uv run pytest`.
- Updated docs were checked against the shipped `maintain`, `policy doctor`, `backup-verify`, `restore --dry-run`, and `rotate-master-key` surfaces.

## 0.12.1 -- Security Hardening Patch

### Changed

- `maintain --format json` and MCP OAuth refresh responses now replace raw refreshed OAuth tokens with short previews and rotation booleans.
- Broker environment materialization now requires the `get_env` action for policy v2 agents while preserving legacy service-list policy behavior.
- Aliasless broker environment requests now fail closed when a service has multiple matching credentials.

### Security

- OAuth provider errors are sanitized before they can reach exception messages, audit reasons, MCP responses, CLI output, or maintenance reports.
- Master-key rotation now writes a durable salt-rotation journal and recovers deterministically if interrupted after database re-encryption.
- Secret scanning now includes common token-bearing dotfiles and reports large secret-like files as warning findings instead of skipping them silently.

### Verification

- Full release validation passed with `uv run pytest` on the 0.12.1 release candidate.
- Version surfaces now report `0.12.1` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, `src/hermes_vault/mcp_server.py`, and `uv.lock`.

## 0.12.0 -- Auth Confidence

### Added

- `hermes-vault oauth doctor [provider] --format table|json` reports provider readiness, PKCE support, device-code support, missing required env vars, default scopes, findings, and safe next commands without token exchange.
- `hermes-vault health --verify-live --service <name>` runs metadata-only provider verification findings for a narrow auth surface before handing credentials to an agent.
- MCP now exposes `oauth_provider_status` so agents can inspect provider readiness without receiving raw tokens, device codes, client secrets, or vault secrets.

### Changed

- OAuth device-login failures now include supported providers, missing env var names, provider status metadata, and safe fallback commands.
- Packaged OAuth defaults now consistently mark Google and GitHub as device-code-capable.
- README, operator docs, MCP docs, architecture notes, and site copy now describe the current browserless first-login and auth-readiness surface.
- Version surfaces now report `0.12.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, and `src/hermes_vault/mcp_server.py`.

### Security

- Auth readiness outputs are metadata-only and never include raw credentials, OAuth token responses, client secrets, device codes, encrypted payloads, or vault secret values.
- Health JSON output is now machine-readable without the decorative banner prefix.

### Release Ops

- Site release copy and dashboard screenshots were refreshed, with a deploy guardrail script for the Hermes Vault static site.

## 0.11.0 -- First Safe Agent

### Added

- `hermes-vault bootstrap` guides operators from a plaintext `.env` into redacted import preview, encrypted vault import, policy-doctor summary, generated skill contract next steps, broker-env next command, and an MCP config snippet.
- `hermes-vault oauth login <provider> --headless` routes supported providers through the existing device-code flow while keeping `--no-browser` as browser callback fallback.
- MCP now exposes `oauth_device_login` so agent-in-the-loop onboarding can initiate device-code login without a callback browser.

### Changed

- Quick-start docs now lead with the First Safe Agent flow instead of a loose scan/import command chain.
- Version surfaces now report `0.11.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, and `src/hermes_vault/mcp_server.py`.

### Security

- Bootstrap JSON and human output are redacted by design and never include secret values.
- MCP device login returns user authorization instructions and pending state only. Raw OAuth access tokens, refresh tokens, and provider token responses are never returned through MCP.
- `--dry-run` bootstrap does not mutate the vault or source `.env`; `--redact-source` only comments out lines that were successfully imported.

## 0.10.1 -- Device-Code Login Follow-up

### Added

- `hermes-vault oauth device-login <provider>` adds a no-browser OAuth device-code flow for supported providers, so headless operators can complete first login without a local callback browser.
- Device-code support now threads through the CLI and OAuth exchange layer, including provider capability checks and token polling.

### Changed

- Version surfaces now report `0.10.1` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, and `src/hermes_vault/mcp_server.py`.

## 0.10.0 -- Unattended OAuth and Custom Verifiers

### Added

- Generic custom verifiers now work through `HERMES_VAULT_VERIFY_URL_<SERVICE>` environment variables, so any OpenAI-compatible endpoint can verify a service without writing a plugin.
- `hermes-vault oauth refresh <service>` now handles unattended OAuth renewal from the paired `refresh:<alias>` record and fails closed if renewal cannot succeed.
- `hermes-vault maintain` can batch refresh and health checks for scheduled-safe operator runs.

### Changed

- Refresh policy guidance now points OAuth-capable agents to the existing `rotate` permission instead of a hypothetical refresh-specific action.
- Version surfaces now report `0.10.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, and `src/hermes_vault/mcp_server.py`.

### Security

- Browserless renewal does not expose raw access or refresh tokens in docs, dashboard, or MCP outputs.

## 0.9.0 -- Profile, Verifier, and MCP Expansion

### Added

- **Credential tags and notes** -- top-level tags and notes now persist through encryption, schema migration, CLI add/import/list/metadata paths, dashboard views, MCP metadata, and backup round-trips.
- **MCP resources** -- `vault://services`, `vault://services/{name}`, `vault://health`, and `vault://policy` expose read-only broker and health data without raw secrets or encrypted payloads.
- **Verifier plugins** -- file-based YAML verifier plugins and entry-point discovery extend provider verification while preserving the existing broker compatibility path.
- **Multi-vault profiles** -- profile-aware home resolution isolates pending OAuth state, verifier plugin directories, and CLI/dashboard/MCP flows across vault profiles.
- **Community onboarding docs** -- CONTRIBUTING guidance, issue templates, PR template, and architecture docs now give contributors a clearer path into the repo.

### Changed

- Version surfaces now report `0.9.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `src/hermes_vault/__init__.py`, and `src/hermes_vault/mcp_server.py`.
- Current release validation passed the full pytest suite and import check before the version bump was recorded.


## 0.8.0 -- Hermes Vault Console Release

### Added

- **Local dashboard** (`hermes-vault dashboard`) -- token-guarded Hermes Vault Console served from packaged assets on `127.0.0.1`.
- **Dashboard views** -- operator surfaces for health, credential inventory, policy findings, audit activity, MCP binding, operations, and recovery posture.
- **Safe dashboard actions** -- health, policy doctor, credential verification, OAuth refresh dry-run, maintenance dry-run, backup verification, and restore dry-run through existing service-layer workflows.
- **Brand assets** -- bundled console brand media for the vault-door intro and local dashboard experience.

### Changed

- OAuth refresh and maintenance are dry-run-only from the dashboard in v0.8.0. Live execution remains available through the CLI.
- Dashboard static assets are packaged as Python package data so installed wheel and source distributions can serve the console without remote assets.

### Security

- Dashboard URLs use a per-process launch token and localhost binding.
- Dashboard JSON serializes credential metadata only and redacts raw secret, raw OAuth token, provider token response, and encrypted payload material from browser-facing responses.
- Credential editing, policy editing, destructive restore, cloud sync, remote binding, plaintext export, and master-key rotation remain outside the dashboard surface.

### Release QA

- Desktop and mobile visual smoke checks cover the packaged dashboard, first-run intro path, bundled asset loading, text overflow, and control overlap.
- Package QA verifies the wheel and sdist include `hermes_vault/dashboard_static/` assets.

## 0.7.2 -- Env Import Idempotency Follow-up

### Changed

- Repeated `.env` imports now compare the incoming secret against the stored `(service, alias)` pair first, report `Already imported` when unchanged, and update in place when the secret changed.

## 0.7.1 -- Env Import UX Hotfix

### Added

- `hermes-vault import --from-env` now supports `--dry-run` previews that show importable and skipped env vars without opening or mutating the vault.
- `--map ENV_NAME=service:credential_type` can be repeated to explicitly import custom names, DB URLs, passwords, or app secrets when the operator chooses to map them.
- Common AI/dev env hints now cover OpenRouter, FAL, Replicate, ElevenLabs, Resend, Tavily, Brave Search, Cloudflare, Vercel, Hugging Face, Groq, xAI, Gemini, Google API keys, Perplexity, and SerpAPI.

### Changed

- Unknown env vars are reported as skipped with clear reasons and `--map` hints instead of silently disappearing.
- Safe suffix inference imports `*_API_KEY`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `*_ACCESS_TOKEN` names as service-specific credentials.
- `--redact-source` now reports how many skipped env lines were left unchanged and still redacts only successfully imported lines.

### Security

- Public client config such as `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, broad DB URLs, passwords, JWT/session/app secrets, and unknown names remain conservative skips unless explicitly mapped.

## 0.7.0 -- Operational Autonomy Release

### Added

- **Maintenance orchestration** (`hermes-vault maintain`) -- scheduled-safe OAuth refresh, health checks, stale-verification checks, backup-age warnings, JSON/table output, dry-run mode, and systemd helper output via `--print-systemd`.
- **Policy doctor** (`hermes-vault policy doctor`) -- read-only policy inspection for least-privilege drift, risky grants, unknown actions/capabilities, stale generated skills, and OAuth readiness gaps. Supports `--strict` for automation.
- **OAuth normalization** (`hermes-vault oauth normalize`) -- dry-run-by-default migration for v0.6 OAuth records, including sanitized token metadata and alias-scoped refresh-token pairing.
- **MCP allowed-agent binding** -- `HERMES_VAULT_MCP_ALLOWED_AGENTS` and `HERMES_VAULT_MCP_DEFAULT_AGENT` can bind a server instance to a known agent set when hosts omit caller identity.
- **Backup verification and restore drill** -- `hermes-vault backup-verify --input <backup-file>` and `hermes-vault restore --dry-run --input <backup-file>` validate decryptability and recovery shape without mutating the live vault.
- **Audit metadata** -- audit records can carry structured metadata for maintenance, backup verification, and restore drill events without exposing secrets.

### Changed

- OAuth refresh tokens are now stored under deterministic alias-scoped records such as `refresh:work`, with legacy `refresh` fallback during migration.
- OAuth access-token metadata is sanitized to provider-safe fields such as provider, token type, issue/expiry timestamps, and scopes.
- Documentation now covers v0.7.0 operator workflows, MCP binding, OAuth normalization, and recovery proof.
- `pyproject.toml`, package `__version__`, MCP server metadata, and lockfile package metadata now report `0.7.0`.

### Security

- MCP binding reduces reliance on caller-supplied `agent_id` in known deployment topologies.
- OAuth normalization removes token-bearing metadata such as raw token responses from access-token records.
- Backup verification and dry-run restore prove encrypted backup readability before an incident while leaving the live vault unchanged.
- Maintenance and recovery events are audited without logging raw secrets.

## 0.6.0 -- OAuth PKCE and Token Auto-Refresh Release

### Added

- **OAuth PKCE login** (`hermes-vault oauth login <provider>`) -- browser-based PKCE login flow with built-in providers (`google`, `github`, `openai`) and custom provider support via YAML. Tokens stored automatically. Supports `--alias`, `--scope`, `--no-browser`, `--port`, and `--timeout`.
- **Token auto-refresh engine** (`hermes-vault oauth refresh <service>`) -- detects expired or near-expiry access tokens (default proactive margin 300s) and refreshes using stored refresh tokens. Supports `--all`, `--dry-run`, and configurable `--margin`. Exponential backoff with configurable `max_retries` (default 3) and `base_backoff_seconds` (default 2s).
- **OAuth provider registry** (`hermes-vault/oauth/providers.py`) -- YAML-backed registry at `~/.hermes/hermes-vault-data/oauth-providers.yaml`. Seeds built-in defaults automatically. Reads `client_id`/`client_secret` from `HERMES_VAULT_OAUTH_<PROVIDER>_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` env vars.
- **MCP OAuth tools** -- `oauth_login` and `oauth_refresh` exposed as MCP tools. `oauth_login` returns an authorization URL and completes the flow in a background thread. `oauth_refresh` triggers the `RefreshEngine` and returns structured results including token previews.
- **Full OAuth package** under `src/hermes_vault/oauth/`: `pkce.py` (RFC 7636 S256), `state.py` (CSRF nonce generation/validation), `callback.py` (ephemeral HTTP server), `exchange.py` (token endpoint POST), `flow.py` (orchestrator), `oauth_refresh.py` (RefreshEngine), `errors.py` (typed exceptions), `providers.py` (registry).
- **OAuth CLI commands** -- `hermes-vault oauth login`, `hermes-vault oauth refresh`, `hermes-vault oauth providers`.
- **Provider-side refresh-token rotation support** -- the RefreshEngine preserves `rotation_counter` and optional `family_id` metadata when a provider returns a new refresh token.
- **MCP integration docs** -- `docs/mcp-server.md` and `docs/mcp-integration.md` updated with OAuth tool schemas, troubleshooting, and architecture notes.

### Changed

- `pyproject.toml` version bumped to `0.6.0`.
- `docs/architecture.md` updated with OAuth module descriptions and security posture.
- `docs/operator-guide.md` updated with OAuth setup, provider registration, token lifecycle, and MCP OAuth tool usage.
- `docs/threat-model.md` updated with OAuth-specific threats and mitigations.
- `README.md` updated with v0.6.0 Whats New section, MCP tool table additions, and common commands.

### Security

- CSRF protection via timing-safe state comparison (`secrets.compare_digest`).
- PKCE S256 required for all flows -- authorization-code interception is mitigated even without a confidential client.
- Callback server binds to `127.0.0.1` only, suppresses HTTP access logging, and accepts exactly one request.
- Refresh tokens stored as separate vault records (alias `"refresh"`) with metadata linking to the access token alias.
- Atomic vault updates -- both access and refresh tokens update in a single SQLite transaction.
- Exponential backoff on transient refresh failures prevents retry storms.
- No raw tokens in stdout/logs except as truncated previews in MCP responses.
- Audit log records every OAuth event (login callback, refresh attempt) without exposing secrets.

## 0.5.0 -- Health, Governance, and Key Rotation Release

### Added

- **Vault health command** (`hermes-vault health`) — read-only health check that
  inspects credential staleness, expiry, invalid status, and backup age in a single
  pass. Composes existing vault status/verification/expiry logic. Outputs structured
  JSON or markdown reports. Exit codes: 0 = healthy, 1 = warnings, 2 = error.
- **Master-key rotation** (`hermes-vault rotate-master-key`) — derives a new master
  key from a new passphrase and re-encrypts every credential atomically. Creates an
  encrypted pre-rotation backup by default. Requires `--skip-backup-dangerous` to
  bypass. Writes an audit event on success.
- **Sync-skill command** (`hermes-vault sync-skill`) — checks or regenerates the
  `hermes-vault-access` SKILL.md from the current policy. Skills now embed a
  SHA-256 policy hash for deterministic stale detection. Supports `--check`,
  `--write`, and `--print`. Exit code 0 = current, 1 = stale.
- **Metadata-only backup** (`hermes-vault backup --metadata-only`) — exports
  credential metadata without encrypted payloads, safe for diff/inspection.
- **Backup with audit** (`hermes-vault backup --include-audit`) — includes audit
  log entries in the backup file.
- **Vault diff command** (`hermes-vault diff --against <path>`) — compares current
  vault metadata against a backup file. Shows added, removed, and changed
  credentials. Never exposes secrets. Accepts both full and metadata-only backups.
- **Governance warnings** in broker `get_ephemeral_env` decisions — expiry warnings
  when credentials are within `HERMES_VAULT_EXPIRY_WARNING_DAYS` (default 7) and
  backup reminders when the last backup exceeds `HERMES_VAULT_BACKUP_REMINDER_DAYS`
  (default 30). Warnings live in `metadata.warnings[]` and never contain raw secrets.
- **Configurable thresholds** via environment variables:
  `HERMES_VAULT_EXPIRY_WARNING_DAYS`, `HERMES_VAULT_BACKUP_REMINDER_DAYS`

### Changed

- `vault.export_backup()` now accepts `metadata_only` parameter to exclude
  encrypted payloads.
- `vault.import_backup()` rejects metadata-only backups with a clear error.
- `SkillGenerator` now embeds a policy hash (`<!-- hv-policy-hash: ... -->`) in
  generated skills for stale detection.
- `PolicyEngine` gains `compute_policy_hash()` for deterministic policy hashing.
- `AppSettings` gains `expiry_warning_days`, `backup_reminder_days`, and
  `governance_warnings_enabled` properties from env vars.

### Security

- Master-key rotation is atomic: if any credential fails re-encryption, the entire
  operation rolls back.
- Pre-rotation encrypted backups are created by default before key rotation.
- Metadata-only backups and diff never expose encrypted payloads or raw secrets.
- Governance warnings never leak raw secrets — only metadata (days-until-expiry,
  days-since-backup).

## 0.4.0 — Credential Observability Release

### Added

- **Audit query CLI** (`hermes-vault audit`) — query access logs with filters:
  --agent, --service, --action, --decision, --since/--until (relative or ISO date),
  --format table|json, --limit. Always ordered newest-first. Empty results exit 0.
- **Credential status CLI** (`hermes-vault status`) — inspect credential health:
  --stale Nd (not verified in N days), --invalid (invalid/expired status),
  --expiring Nd (expiring within N days), --format table|json. Credentials with
  last_verified_at=null are always stale. Target + filters work together.
- **Expiry metadata commands** (`hermes-vault set-expiry` / `clear-expiry`) —
  operator-controlled expiry tracking via --days N or --date YYYY-MM-DD.
  Both write audit entries. Expiry round-trips through backup/restore.
- **Verification report output** — `verify --all` now accepts --format table
  and --report PATH. Default JSON-to-stdout behavior is unchanged.
  --report writes stable JSON with parent-dir creation and chmod 0600.

### Changed

- Audit log gains indexes on agent_id, service, and timestamp
  (`CREATE IF NOT EXISTS` — no migration needed).
- Credentials table gains indexes on status, last_verified_at, and expiry
  (`CREATE IF NOT EXISTS` — no migration needed).

### Security

- No secret values appear in audit log entries, status output, or verification
  reports. encrypted_payload is never included in any JSON output.
- No background processes, no daemon, no auto-rotation.

## 0.3.1 — MCP Hotfix Release

### Fixed

- **MCP alias handling** — `get_ephemeral_env` now resolves aliases inside the broker after the policy gate, preventing UUID-vs-name policy mismatches that could cause incorrect denials
- **MCP metadata leak** — `get_credential_metadata` now excludes `encrypted_payload` from responses; raw encrypted bytes are no longer exposed over stdio
- **MCP `expires_at`** — `get_ephemeral_env` now computes and returns a real `expires_at` ISO timestamp instead of `null`
- **Policy model strictness** — `AgentPolicy` and `PolicyConfig` now reject unknown fields (`extra="forbid"`), preventing silent misconfiguration when operators use outdated field names
- **Docs/examples field names** — `docs/operator-guide.md` and test fixtures corrected to use `max_ttl_seconds` and `ephemeral_env_only`, matching the actual model schema
- **MCP server initialization** — broker is cached as a singleton via `_get_broker()` instead of rebuilding on every tool call
- **MCP transport safety** — logging redirected to `~/.hermes/hermes-vault-data/mcp.log` instead of `stderr`, preventing JSON-RPC framing corruption

## 0.3.0 — MCP Server Release

### Added

- **MCP server transport** (`hermes-vault mcp`) — stdio-based MCP server using the official Python MCP SDK
- **MCP tool surface** — 6 tools exposed: `list_services`, `get_credential_metadata`, `get_ephemeral_env`, `verify_credential`, `rotate_credential`, `scan_for_secrets`
- **Agent identity propagation** — every MCP tool call requires `agent_id`; policy v2 enforcement works unchanged through the broker
- **Update command family** (`hermes-vault update --check`, `hermes-vault update`) — install-method detection, guarded auto-update for pip/pipx/uv tool, safe refusal with manual instructions for unsupported methods
- `mcp` dependency in `pyproject.toml`

### Changed

- README updated with MCP server section, tool reference table, and update command reference
- `docs/architecture.md` updated with MCP transport layer description
- `docs/operator-guide.md` updated with MCP setup instructions, agent registration workflow, and troubleshooting
- `docs/threat-model.md` updated with MCP threat model and operator mitigations

### Security

- Raw secrets are never transmitted over MCP — only ephemeral environment materialization and metadata
- All MCP tool calls route through the existing broker and VaultMutations layers — no parallel policy authority

## 0.2.0 — Contract Hardening Release

### Added

- Policy v2 with per-service action permissions and legacy compatibility
- Canonical service IDs across vault, broker, policy, and scan/import flows
- Deterministic credential targeting for alias and multi-credential scenarios
- Centralized audited mutation paths for add, rotate, delete, metadata, and verification-related updates
- Agent-level capabilities for non-service-scoped actions
- CLI alignment with canonical service IDs, deterministic selectors, and policy v2

### Changed

- Expanded test suite and release documentation for the 0.2.0 contract

## 0.1.0 — Initial Release

### Added

- Local encrypted vault (SQLite-backed, PBKDF2 + AES-GCM)
- CLI for scan, import, add, list, verify, rotate, delete, backup, restore
- Secret scanner with pluggable detectors and permission checks
- Credential verifier with provider-specific adapters
- Backup and restore for vault portability
- Skill generation for Hermes agent contracts
